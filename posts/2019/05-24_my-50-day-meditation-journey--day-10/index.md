I first heard about Sam Harris through an episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. In that particular episode, Tim plays an audio essay by Sam about his views on psychedelic drugs and the mind, which is that when used carefully, psychedelic drugs can induce states of mind that are otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve through normal behaviors such as meditation or exercise. Referring to one of his earliest experiences with LSD, Sam talked about feeling a strange yet unconditional love for all human beings while tripping with his longtime friend. In short, he believes that all human beings should have the right to guide their own consciousness, owing it to ourselves to discover all that our brains are capable of.

> The power of psychedelics, however, is that they often reveal, in the span of a few hours, depths of awe and understanding that can otherwise elude us for a lifetime. — Sam Harris

Intrigued by what he had to say, I listened to more of Sam Harris’ content, in which he talks about separating spirituality from religion, asserting that theism or prayer are just some of the ways to induce these non-ordinary states of consciousness. For him, the technique of choice is _vipassana,_ or mindfulness meditation. The goal of _vipassana_ is to practice holding an open, unbiased attention toward one’s state of mind, which is said to hold benefits such as being more intentional, less distraction-prone, less-stressed, and more present.

So when I heard that he had a 50 day guided-meditation series, I knew I wanted to give it a shot. I figured it would be a safer bet than suddenly becoming a drug user. The series, called the Waking Up Course, is a set of 50 guided meditations, each about 10 minutes long, accompanied by 33 lessons on the how and why of meditation.

#### The First 10 Days

Now that it’s been 10 days, what can I say about my experience so far? For starters, almost half of those sessions have been utter failures. I either ate too much before or started meditating too late in the day, drifting in and out of sleep from the induced relaxation. But relaxation, as I have learned, is not really the point of mindfulness meditation. Naturally, as we try to clear our mind and focus on something repetitive like our breath, the body begins to unwind and feel at ease. After all, this is one of the most popular pieces of advice for falling asleep.

Instead, I’m practicing to focus on being in the moment. Starting with my breath, I begin to notice all the physical sensations that I feel, like the rush of air through my nostrils or the chair pressing against my back. As it turns out, latching onto these physical details is really important for the mental aspect of mindfulness meditation, mostly because of all the random thoughts that can pop into your head. Especially in the first few sessions, my mind was all over the place, thinking about the events of my day, or the YouTube video that I had just watched. This level of cognitive activity is natural to me, but I did not realize how much they noise they were producing in my head until I tried to shut them off.

What I like about Sam’s course is that he encourages you to acknowledge these random thoughts, prompting you to think about where the thought comes from, and where it goes. I have yet to figure out how to do that second part, but I do know that having this reminder baked into the recording is really helpful for beginners like me. After 10 days, I’m finding it ever so slightly easier to follow a thought from start to finish, reaching that conclusion and filing it away so I can return to an empty mind.

In one of the lessons, Sam talks about external factors like ambient noise, saying that meditation does not always have to be done in a quiet room. Hearing a conversation nearby or feeling the breeze against your skin are perfectly valid ways of experiencing the present, albeit difficult ones. For now, I’ll still be sticking to the solitude of my bedroom.

#### What Next?

As I continue on this 50 day journey, I hope to start applying some of the skills I’m learning in meditation throughout the day. As an anxious person, I could see a huge benefit from being able to stay in the now and abstaining from negative and unproductive thoughts that constantly threaten to creep into focus. I will try to write another update before I finish the course, so please stay tuned.

_Until next time…_
